CYSCOM, the Cybersecurity Community of VIT Chennai, a recognized student community by AICTE, Government of India, is a community of students passionate about cybersecurity. We aim to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and teach students how to protect themselves.

Originally a small group of students with a shared vision of cyber safety, CYSCOM has grown into a large and active community with members and associates from all walks of life.

Join us on our mission to make cyberspace a safer place for everyone.
