# My hostel room key

* Author: K S Vignesh


1.	Decode the key given in the text file 3 times using Base64 to get a decrypted string.

2.	You will find a Google Drive link — follow it.

3.	You will get a PDF there; go to the last page and you will find another Google Drive link to download an image. 

4.	Download the image and open it using Notepad.

5.	There you will see a flag-like text inside curly brackets, but it is not the final flag (you’re almost there).

6.	Decode the string present inside the curly brackets 6 times using Base64.

7.	You will get the final answer, which should be placed inside curly brackets.

FLAG:   CBCV{FINAL_FLAG}
